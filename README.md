This project is about the realization of a compiler for the Micro Java programming language. 
The compiler enables the translation of syntactically and semantically correct Microjava programs into Microjava bytecode that is executed on a virtual machine
for Microjava. Syntactically and semantically correct Microjava programs are defined by the [MJ] specification.
